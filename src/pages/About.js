        <PageTitle>Hi there!</PageTitle>
        <p>
          My name is Alice Hendicott and am currently working as a Software
          Developer Graduate for REA Group based in Melbourne, Australia. I
          graduated with a double bachelors degree of Applied Mathematics and
          Computer Science from Queensland University of Technology, so in a
          nutshell I love problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the past three years I have worked in front end web development
          creating conference websites for events accros the world. In my
          current role as a graduate, I have had the opportunity to work across
          several teams in REA Group. For 6 months, I was working on
          maintaining, improving and integrating the design system used accross
          our websites. I have also had the opportunnity to contribute to a
          major feature release on Australiaâ€™s number one website in property. I
          am currently working on improving my back end development skills by
          working on some of our customer systems.
